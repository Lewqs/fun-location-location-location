  "description": "This function will be called with an array of objects, each object representing a student on the Northcoders bootcamp. Some of the students have a specified location property which is a string of the office they will be attending during their time on the course, but for some students that property is missing. Your function should return a _new array_, where all objects that were missing a location have been updated so that they now have a location property with a value of \"remote\". All other properties should remain as they were. This function must be a _pure function_, i.e. it should have no side effects, and your test suite should reflect this.",
